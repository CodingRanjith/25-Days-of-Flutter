## Overview

Welcome to Day 2 of our 25 Days of Flutter series! Today, we'll focus on getting your development environment set up for Flutter development. By the end of this session, you'll have Flutter installed on your machine and ready to create your first Flutter project.

## Flutter Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Flutter SDK

- Follow the official documentation to download and install the Flutter SDK on your machine: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

- Make sure to add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH variable to access Flutter commands globally.

### 2. Set Up IDE

- Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Flutter development. Popular options include:
  - **Visual Studio Code:** Install the Flutter and Dart plugins from the VS Code marketplace. [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - **Android Studio:** Install the Flutter plugin from the IDE settings or marketplace.
- Configure your IDE to use the Flutter SDK installed on your machine.

### 3. Verify Installation

- Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Flutter is installed correctly:
  ```bash
  flutter --version
  ```
  ```bash
  flutter doctor
  ```

You should see the Flutter version information displayed in the terminal.

### 4. Create Your First Flutter Project

- Now that Flutter is installed, let's create a new Flutter project. Navigate to your desired directory and run the following command:

```bash
flutter create my_app
```

<div align="center">

</div>

This will generate a new Flutter project with the name my_app.

### 5. Run Your Flutter Project

- Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to launch your Flutter app on an emulator or connected device:

```bash
cd my_app
flutter run
```

Congratulations! You've successfully set up Flutter on your machine and created your first Flutter project.
